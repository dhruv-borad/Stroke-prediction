# Stroke-prediction
In the given dataset we used k-means and logistic regression to forecast whether the patient can have stroke or not. We had to deal with imbalanced data which is common in such healthcare problems. We removed the rows with empty cells (NA values) and for smoking status we removed the unknown labels as it was considered as missing data. But it could have in other way like Age less than 10 or 15 years patients could have been tagged as never smoked etc. We saw that age, BMI, and glucose level are the most important features when it comes to predicting stroke-prone individuals, based on the current dataset. It was also observed that women are prone to stroke on average at a much older age in comparison to males which experiences strokes on average as soon. We saw that k-means, logistic regression and decision tree were trained on an unsampled version of the original dataset yielded satisfiable results and the accuracy of the original model was improved with 10-fold cross validation.
